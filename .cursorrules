# Cursor Project Rules

[available_instructions]
pytest_naming: |
  Use pytest discovery configuration from `pyproject.toml`:
  - test paths: `tests`
  - test files: `it_*.py`, `test_*.py`
  - test classes: `Describe[A-Z]*`
  - test functions: `it_*`
  Follow existing tests that use classes like `DescribeSomething` with methods named `it_*`.

public_api_reexports: |
  `valid8r` top-level must re-export:
  - modules: `parsers`, `validators`, `combinators`, and `prompt` (with `ask` exposed in `valid8r.prompt`).
  - types: `Maybe` from `valid8r.core.maybe`.
  Maintain backward compatibility for deep imports.

run_tests_locally: |
  In constrained environments without pytest installed, use a Python smoke test importing:
  `from valid8r import parsers, validators, prompt, Maybe` and assert `prompt.ask` is callable.

[default]
- When adding tests, ensure names match the `Describe*` / `it_*` style so they are discovered.
- Avoid changing unrelated formatting; match repo code style and ruff rules.
